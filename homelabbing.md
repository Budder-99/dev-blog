## Homelab!
_"A homelab is a setup of one or more servers located in a home, used for testing various hardware configurations, operating systems, and applications. It serves as a personal environment for experimentation, learning, and development in computing."_

This allows me to gain experience in IT outside of the workplace as well as having fun!
